Imagine you are developing an app step by step. Tasks appear as you develop the app. Create a new git repository and solve them. Remember to open access and send us a link.

1. Develop a task management system. Each task should have its own status, description, and users assigned to it. 
2. Statuses:  new, in progress, completed, archived.
3. The system should provide the user roles. Only the administrator should be able to archive tasks.
4. Users assigned to tasks receive notifications about changes by email.
5. Users should be able to comment on the tasks. Only administrators can delete comments.
6. Donâ€™t forget about tests. This should be a stripped version with only the necessary aspects.
7. Make the frontend part of the app as you want it to be. Use modern frameworks and approaches during your work.
